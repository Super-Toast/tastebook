 find recipes for different food categories

 the app fetches an api with recipes. the user can search for specific meals or can browse them by category, first letter or can select a random recipe.

 while on a recipe page, the user can edit the instructions and save them locally. if the user wants to acces the same recipe later on, he has the option to switch between the original list of instructions or the edited one.
